This is a testing repository for asir-contrib at the github.
asir-contrib has been developed at the openxm cvs repository, 
but cvs will not be convenient for some developers.
asir-contrib at the github will be periodically merged to the asir-contrib
at the openxm cvs repository and will be included in the asir package.
The github user name will be changed to openxm-at-git in a fugure.
